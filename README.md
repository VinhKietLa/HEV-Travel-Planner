## Built with...

- React

- Node.js

- Vanilla Bootstrap & React Bootstrap

- Server APIs

- Deployed using Netlify

## What we learned

- The importance of project scoping in order to develop fully functional application: in comparison to our first project we have encountered some challenges and thus some features remain unfinished

- The importance of finding the right APIs for our needs: it would have been beneficial if we spent a bit more time in deciding on which APIs to use to ensure we can render the information we need

- Outlining and establishing clear expectations for individual contributions

- Solidified React and JS skills that we've learned so far

## Directions for future development

Things for the future include:

- Fixing map marker landmarks fetch (Map is currently out of order due to API accessibility ü§ë)

- Enabling functionality of searching places based on map marker location

- Add accommodations and car rentals prices and search functionality.

- More flight options, ability to filter results and show flight times as part of the search results.

- Polish UI
